# Epicodus Week 3 Intro: Solo Project

Beep Boop Game: Cat Janowitz; October 27, 2017

#### By Cat Janowitz

## Description

This is a solo project that involves the design of a game that receives a number from the user. In return the user sees an array of number output starting from zero up to the number that was inputted, where every 0 is replaced with a "Beep!", every 1 is replaced with a "Boop!" and every number divisible by 3 is replaced with, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.".

## SPECIFICATIONS

* set input field to numbers so only numbers can be received
* game returns an output of integers in an array, starting at 0 and up to the number inputted
  * Example Input: 4
  * Example Output (to be modified further): [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

* number array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the number %3 === 0 = true, it is replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
  * Example Input: 4
  * Example Output: [0, 1, 2, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4]

* at this point, the array contains both integers and strings. mixed array is converted to one data type, strings, using the .toStrings() method

* string array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the "number" includes "0" = true the "number" is replaced with "Beep!":
  * Example Input: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]
  * Example Output: ["Beep!", "1", "2", "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", "4"]

* string array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the "number" includes "1" = true the "number" is replaced with "Boop!":
  * Example Input: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]
  * Example Output: ["Beep!", "Boop!", "2", "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", "4"]

* string array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the "number" === "10" the "number" is replaced with "Boop!Beep!":
  * Example Input: ["8", "9", "10", "11"]
  * Example Output: ["8", "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", "Boop!Beep!", "11"]

* string array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the "number" === "11" the "number" is replaced with "Boop!Boop!":
  * Example Input: ["8", "9", "10", "11"]
  * Example Output: ["8", "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", "Boop!Beep!", "Boop!Boop!"]

* string array is tested incrementally from left to right using a for-loop; if the "number" === "100" the "number" is replaced with "Boop!Beep!Beep!":
  * Example Input: ["96", "97", "98", "99", "100"]
  * Example Output: ["96", "97", "98", "99", "Boop!Beep!Beep!"]
