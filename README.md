#### By Cat Janowitz

## Description

This is a solo project that involves the design of a game that receives a number from the user. In return the user sees an array of number output starting from zero up to the number that was inputted, where every 0 is replaced with a "Beep!", every 1 is replaced with a "Boop!" and every number divisible by 3 is replaced with, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.".
